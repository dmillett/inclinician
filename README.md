# Inclinician

Funded by me:
**TODO**: www.inclinician.org (website)
**TODO**: hosting (Linode, etc)

An open source project intended to help educate and empower individuals' ability to measure, analyze, diagnose 
and own all data to resolve health issues.

 * Providing an accessible, open platform for individual health data
 * Encouraging better communication between patients, clinical staff, researchers and educators
   - collecting & correlating patient symptom data (voice-to-text: chest tightness, achilles pain, etc)
   - patient diagnostic measurement tools (skin, ultrasound, spectometry, mast cells, cytokines, etc) 
 * Science & health education for doctors, patients and researchers
 * Data analysis to help identify gaps in physiological testing methods

 * [Data Complexity & Detailed Overview](#detailed-overview)
 * [Usage](#usage)
 * [Collaborate](#collaborate)

## Data Complexity & Detailed Overview
Our planet and DNA would not exist without an enormous number of bacterial, viral and environmental influences 
over the course of 1.5+ billion years. The net result is 7+ billion highly unique people within the context of 
diminishing biodiversity and the interaction of our collective immune systems. Individual immune expression is a 
complex differential equation relative to time, stimuli, genetic & adaptive immune response. With over 4 million 
SNPs and hundreds of types of immune cells (cytokines, macrophages, tcells mast, etc) constantly change, there is 
no deterministic formula that works. Billions of data points for immune signaling and adaptive immune responses are 
required for people of different ages and locations. A large enough data matrix makes group correlations possible, 
which in turn invites more data for further refinement. For example, data from household sanitary labs for septic 
waste and air filtration. Data from personalized detection instruments ranging from spectrometers, 
ultrasound/thermal/electro-magnetic field imaging, oxygen/breathe saturation and embedded nano-sampling of immune 
signaling. And finally, voice-to-text symptom description. This will allow for safer and more effective medicines, 
vaccines and treatments. A healthier world of scientific discovery awaits... 
 
 * Providing an accessible, open platform for individual health data 
 * Functional, Specialty and Cultural medicine resources
 * Cataloging and correlating symptoms with lab tests
   - written or voice symptom journaling is valuable data
 * Encouraging better communication between patients, clinical staff, researchers and educators
   - Increasing empathy and understanding to reduce suffering 
 * To Facilitating and incentivizing an individual's ability to share anonymized patient data for research
   - And to and receive research results
   - Blockchain contracts?
 * Educating patients and the medical community on **Functional Medicine** and **custom treatment**
   - Nutrition
   - Detoxing
   - The uniqueness of genetic expression
   - Test availability and lab quality
   - Immune signaling is very dynamic and complex
   - Biological pathogens (bacteria, virus, parasites, etc) & toxins (metals, molds, man-made, etc)
     - protein fragments from immune action
   - Autoimmune conditions  
   - Immune signature key to assign to test result sets
 * Promoting science based data driven advances in complex health systems
   - Understanding statistical confidence
   - Understanding scientific method, **continual measurement**, new variables, etc      
 * Root Cause Analysis
   - Symptoms may be overlapping and caused by a combination of toxins, pathogens and genetic expression
   - **Inflammation usually causes pain** and/or tissue damage, alleviating pain is only part of the answer

### Risks
Due to the large number of unknowns in human physiology, there are a number of existing risks to account for:

 1. Exposure of personal information for abuse by criminals & private or public institutions
 2. Accidental or deliberate falsification of data
 3. Insufficient tests, equipment, data or understanding
 4. Misdiagnosis & poor analysis
 5. Side effects from pharmaceutical, supplements, herbs, vaccines, etc

## Usage

### Labs

In many cases where chronic conditions exist improvements in health are delayed for specific conditions:

 * HLA DRB/Q genetic SNP testing (one time)
   - can indicate potential to accumulate mold toxins and heavy metals
   - http://hla.alleles.org/data/hla-drb.html
 * Genova Ion Panel (repeat as necessary)
   - nutritional evaluation 
   - https://www.gdx.net/product/ion-profile-nutritional-test-blood

## Resources
 * Medschema (https://github.com/dmillett/medschema) 
   - Standardizing symptom and test data into a standard schema or structure
 * Statistical Confidence
 * Scientific Method
 * Cellular Biology
