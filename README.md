   - And to and receive research results
 * Promoting science based data driven advances in complex health systems
   - Understanding statistical confidence
   - Understanding scientific method, **continual measurement**
 * Educating patients and the medical community on **custom treatment**
   - The uniqueness of genetic expression
   - Test availability and lab quality
   - Immune signaling is very dynamic and complex
   - Biological pathogens (bacteria, virus, parasites, etc) & toxins (metals, molds, man-made, etc)
 * Encouraging better communication between patients, clinical staff, researchers and educators
   - Increasing empathy and understanding to reduce suffering
 * Root Cause Analysis
