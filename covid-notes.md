## Science, Complexity & Data
 * Variables can represent genetics & cell types and their rates of change
   * More variables & rates of change means increased complexity
 * Billions of variations & uniqueness require millions of data points for correlation
 * Observation & measurement are required by the scientific method

## Healthcare
* Health insurance companies add significant cost overhead with no medical benefit
    * Single payer systems are more cost effective (demonstrated by many other countries)
* Prescription drugs are very expensive and can add significant risk
    * https://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/new-prescription-drugs-major-health-risk-few-offsetting-advantages
* Hospitals and emergency care facilities have reduced capacities at higher costs
* Industry's decades long focus is on pharmaceuticals and generic investigation
    * Detailed observation & diagnostics are required to better understand unique, complex adaptive systems (us)
* Due to the constraints above, root cause analysis is problematic and chronic patients persist

## Exposure Risk vs Disease Risk vs Treatment Risk
 * Every human is a highly unique, complex and adaptive system
   * Individual immune systems are a function of time, exposure, load, etc
 * How frequently are cell types and genetics measured?
 * How many immune systems test for different pathogen & substance exposure?
   * Metals, mold, toxins, Lyme, Bartonella, Babesia, Mycoplasm, Epstein Barre, etc
 * How much root cause analysis is performed for adverse events on prescription drugs?
   * Many prescription drugs & vaccines are significant immune events
   
## Pathogen Surveillance
* At home testing for multiple pathogens (ex: covid, influenza, cold viruses, strep, etc)
   * ex: SHERLOCK https://news.mit.edu/2020/sherlock-based-one-step-test-provides-rapid-sensitive-covid-19-detection-0505
* Air and Sewage testing
   * cities, municipalities, transit, schools, buildings, homes

## Education, Nutrition & Health
 * Emphasize science & how to observe and measure specific events
   * Encourage inclusivity of data when repeating & refining experiments
   * Encourage sharing all data involved with the experiment(s)
 * Teach how the food we eat is converted into nutrients our bodies need
   * Many things sold in grocery stores make it hard for us to create those nutrients
   * Improper nutrition can result in systemic inflammation & immune dysfunction
   * Toxins, metals, plastics, molds & pathogens can interfere nutrition absorption
 * Let patients own all their data and decide how it is used
   * Fund public research on transparent open source platforms
   * Incentivize people to submit their data for public research & results
   * Establish individual devices for observation & analysis
